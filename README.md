# Digital Sable
---

[Since the continuation of the development on discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c4324f17a80c94776832430007ad40e6) this bot serves as a continuing learning process for me to practice python and to have fun.





## Features (planned/current)
---
### Submissions

Ability to log submissions through`/submissions` command. Logs modal submission to a json file.

---
### SableSearch


An ever growing collection of categorically grouped resources for ease of access. Persists in a ephemeral button menu and contains the the following options as examples:
  ```
  - Useful opensource projects (such as alternatives to expensive closed source API's)
  -LGBT resources
  -Miscellanious websites for fun or utility
  ```
  > `/sablesearch submit` will allow you to submit resources for adding to the list.
